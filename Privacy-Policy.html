            <p>
                AmFx provides functionality to publish debenture data to a Google Doc Spreadsheet. Writing to the Google Doc Spreadsheet requires authentication by Google.
                If Google successfully authenticates, it will provide a token to the AmFx application which can then be used by the AmFx application to write to the
                Debenture Google Doc Spreadsheet.  AmFx may persist the token to avoid repeated authentication prompts, but does not know or use any other user identifying information.
                You may choose not to authenticate, in which case the functionality of publishing to the Google Doc Spreadsheet is unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
                No cookies are used. AmFx is not a web application. It is a client application for personal use. The purpose of this policy is to fulfill Google API requirements 
                which require a privacy policy in order to allow publishing to a Google Doc Spreadsheet.
